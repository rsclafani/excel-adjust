# Excel-Adjust
Menu-driven adjustment macro for Excel workbooks

for making a simple mathematical adjustment to every Cell in the active 
selection. The macro currently supports [+, -, *, /] operators and works
on both static values and formulas.

## Live Usage

* The `Adjust` macro will be automatically added to the top of the Cell 
  right-click menu
* `Adjust.xlsm` can safely be minimized
* The menu item will be unloaded when the workbook is closed
